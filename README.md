stringsmoar is a lot of small helper functions for strings that are not in the standard library (or even in x packages).

I fully understand the need to keep the Go standard library lean and maintainable, but after using Python it can be frustrating having to constantly rewrite simple things.

I hope this open source code is helpful (at the very least as an example of how to approach some of the common problems).

updated to do ContinuousIntegration builds with:
